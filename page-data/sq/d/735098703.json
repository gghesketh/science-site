Late endosomes receive traffic downstream of endocytic pathways (e.g., macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis) and engage in a variety of recycling pathways (e.g., retromer pathway). Storage lysosomes are effectively \"sacs\" of hydrolytic enzymes, which become active upon fusion with late endosomes. This results in degradation of the endolysosomal luminal contents and the liberation of nutrients from the breakdown of macromolecules. Soluble nutrients (e.g., amino acids) can be transported directly to the cytoplasm, whereas insoluble nutrients (e.g., lipids) are transferred from endolysosomes to other organelles via membrane contact sites and lipid transfer proteins.<br>\n<br>\nThe mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) kinase complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of nutrient-dependent cellular processes. Nutrients, acting through a variety of distinct nutrient sensing mechanisms, control the activation state of mTORC1.

My name is Geoffrey Hesketh. I am a molecular cell biologist, **fascinated by how lysosomes control the balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways in cells.** Specifically, I study how nutrients are sensed on the surfaces of lysosomal system organelles and how this is coupled to the activation state of mTORC1, a master growth regulator. mTORC1 in turn broadly controls cellular anabolism (i.e., macromolecular biosynthesis) and catabolism (i.e., macromolecular breakdown). These pathways are central to the pathogenesis of human diseases including mutant Ras-driven cancers (e.g., pancreatic cancer), neurodegeneration, and infectious diseases. In pursuit of these questions I employ **proximity-dependent biotinylation and mass spectrometry (e.g., BioID), CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing**, and a variety of **classical molecular cell biology** techniques.\
\
I am currently an Assistant Professor in the **Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology** in the Faculty of Medicine at **Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada**. I was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of [Dr. Anne-Claude Gingras](https://gingraslab.org/ "Link to the Gingras Lab website") at the [Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI)](https://www.lunenfeld.ca/ "Link to the LTRI website") in Toronto, Ontario. I previously completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratories of Prof. Paul Luzio and Prof. David Owen at the [Cambridge Institute for Medical Research (CIMR)](https://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk/ "Link to the CIMR website") at the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, UK.\
\
I completed my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Van Eyk and Dr. Gordon Tomaselli in the [Department of Biological Chemistry](http://biolchem.bs.jhmi.edu/Pages/default.aspx "Link to the JHUSOM Department of Biological Chemistry website") at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.\

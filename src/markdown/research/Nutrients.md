My extensive BioID screen investigating lysosomal system membrane trafficking and signalling has allowed the generation of multiple hypotheses related to lysosomal control of cellular nutrient biology. **Initial projects will investigate:**\
\
**a) Mechanistic roles for the Rab7-coordinated HOPS and Retromer complexes in controlling nutrient-dependent late endosome-lysosome fusion and recycling.**\
\
**b) Mechanistic basis for membrane contacts and lipid transfer proteins in controling nutrient (e.g., cholesterol) acquisition, cellular distribution, and signalling.**\
\
**c) Mechanisms of nutrient-dependent regulation of gene expression.**\
\
Collectively, through these studies I aim to **illuminate how defects in lysosomal control of cellular anabolic-catabolic balance cause human disease.**

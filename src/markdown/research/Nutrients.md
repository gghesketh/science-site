My extensive BioID screen investigating lysosomal system membrane trafficking and signalling has allowed the generation of multiple hypotheses related to lysosomal control of cellular nutrient biology. Initial projects will include the following.\
\
a) Investigate mechanistic roles for the Rab7-coordinated HOPS and Retromer complexes in controlling nutrient-dependent late endosome-lysosome fusion and recycling.

Proximity-dependent biotinylation with biotin protein ligases and mass spectrometry (referred to here as BioID) is a powerful technique allowing the identifcation of proximity-dependent associations within protein communities in live cells. Please see this [recent review from the lab](https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(20)35002-7/fulltext "Link to review in Molecular Cellular Proteomics") for a detailed explanation of proximity-dependent biotinylation techniques. Using BioID on a large scale, combined with advanced data analysis techniques, the lab created a BioID proximity map of the HEK293 proteome called the **[Human Cell Map](https://humancellmap.org/ "Link to the Human Cell Map")**. This project was recently **[published in the journal *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03592-2 "Link to the publication in Nature")** (C. Go and J. Knight co-first authors).\
\
I have used BioID to profile greater than 100 proteins involved in lysosomal system membrane trafficking and mTORC1 signalling. This work has resulted in a rich dataset from which multiple hypotheses will be tested functionally. Importantly, certain baits behave as "organelle sensors" and, when combined with a technique I developed called "Knockout BioID" (KO-BioID), provide detailed mechanistic insight into trafficking and signalling events occurring on organelle surfaces. KO-BioID using the lysosomal system SNARE proteins VAMP7 and VAMP8 was the catalyst that led to **[my recent publication in *Science*.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6514/351 "Link to my recent paper in Science")**\
\
In my independent career I will continue to use **BioID as a central discovery tool**, gaining mechanistic insight into lysosomal control of cellular anabolic and catabolic pathways.\
\
Projects will fall under **two broad aims**, further outlined in the following sections.\
\
**i) Investigate mechanisms by which lysosome-driven growth pathways fuel highly lethal mutant Ras-driven cancers.**\
\
**ii) Investigate the role of the lysosomal system in orchestrating cellular nutrient biology.**

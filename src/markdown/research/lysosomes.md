The lysosomal system consists of late endosomes, lysosomes, and the product of their fusion, endolysosomes. Late endosomes receive traffic downstream of endocytic pathways (e.g., macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis) and engage in a variety of recycling pathways (e.g., retromer pathway). Storage lysosomes are effectively "sacs" of hydrolytic enzymes, which become active upon fusion with late endosomes. This results in degradation of the endolysosomal luminal contents and the liberation of nutrients from the breakdown of macromolecules. Soluble nutrients (e.g., amino acids) can be transported directly to the cytoplasm, whereas insoluble nutrients (e.g., lipids) are transferred from endolysosomes to other organelles via membrane contact sites and lipid transfer proteins.\

The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) kinase complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of nutrient-dependent cellular processes. Nutrients, acting through a variety of distinct nutrient sensing mechanisms, control the activation state of mTORC1. In response, mTORC1 broadly controls the balance between cellular anabolism (i.e., creation of biomass from nutrients) and cellular catabolism (i.e., the breakdown of biomass to generate nutrients) according to nutrient availability. **Importantly, nutrient sensing and activation of mTORC1 occurs on the surfaces of lysosomal system organelles.**\

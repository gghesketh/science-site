Oncogenic Ras-driven cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, are highly lethal with virtually no targeted therapies available. A major consequence of oncogenic Ras expression in cells is the constitutive activation of macropinocytosis (cellular "drinking"), allowing massive uptake and endolysosomal degradation of macromolecule-rich extracellular fluid. These **[lysosome-derived nutrients activate mTORC1 through a novel mechanism](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6514/351 "Link to my recent paper in Science")**, and can fuel cancer cell growth in the nutrient-deprived tumour microenvironment.\
\
**I will use a combination of BioID, genome-wide CRISPR screens, and hypothesis-driven cell biology to investigate mechanisms of mTORC1 activation by lysosome-derived nutrients and its contribution to Ras-driven cancer pathobiology.**

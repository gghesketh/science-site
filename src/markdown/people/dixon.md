Hi everyone! My name is Toni-Anne Dixon and I am from the beautiful island of Jamaica. I am in my first year of my masters degree in the Hesketh Lab. One of my favourite things about Halifax is the number of different cafes around town, whether I need to get some work done or meet up with someone for a cup of coffee, I can always seem to find one to match the vibe. My project is one Iâ€™m particularly excited about and will be focused on how endolysosomal derived nutrients activate mTORC1, specifically in mutant RAS-driven cancer cells.
